title: "Managing my infrastructure with OpenTofu"
---

### Motivation

The main motivation for me moving most of infrastructure's configuration to 
OpenTofu is because I am quite forgetful and having all my configuration in one 
place makes it easier to keep track of.

### Secret management

Rather than keep secrets in a text file on disk, I keep them all in a 1Password 
vault. To use these secrets with OpenTofu to access my various cloud accounts, 
I use [secret references](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-references/)
in a `.env` file and run `tofu` with `op run --env-file=".env" -- tofu`. The
`op run` command looks at your environment variables and, if any are secret 
references, replaces them with the appropriate secret.

### Remote state management

I use [Cloudflare's R2 Object Storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) 
for storing my OpenTofu state file. We can use OpenTofu's `"s3"` backend to
configure R2 as it comes with an S3 compatible API. Cloudflare have 
[helpfully documented](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/advanced-topics/remote-backend/)
the required configuration options to get this working.

```tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "daniellemaywood"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "auto"

    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_metadata_api_check     = true
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_requesting_account_id  = true
    skip_s3_checksum            = true
    use_path_style              = true

    endpoints = {
      s3 = "https://6b1f203f12648e063d24e9d81346523c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Declaring my resources

### Importing resources

To avoid any downtime (not that I host anything mission critical), I decided
to import my resources into my OpenTofu state file rather than deleting then 
re-creating them.

I had to import the following resources: [my Cloudflare zone](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/cloudflare/cloudflare/v4.47.0/docs/resources/zone#import),
[my Cloudflare records](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/cloudflare/cloudflare/v4.47.0/docs/resources/record),
and [my Cloudflare Pages project](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/cloudflare/cloudflare/v4.47.0/docs/resources/pages_project).
